UK,inflation,Bank of England,1-Nov-2021,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2021/november-2021,"We expect inflation to rise to around 5% in the spring next year. We expect these high rates of inflation to be temporary. We don’t think that demand will continue to rise as fast, and many of the shortages that are currently making it difficult for businesses to produce their products should ease. We expect inflation to fall back from the middle of next year, and to be close to our target in two years’ time.",,,A,
